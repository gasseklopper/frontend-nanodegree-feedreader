# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.


# Jquery Testing in Jasmine.js for the Project Feedreader
in this project we use jasmin.js to test a feedreader


# How to run the app

## Start
clone or download [this](https://github.com/gasseklopper/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader.git) git repository to your local machine. Open `index.html` and you are  able to see the feeds load, see the
jasmin.js testing values on the bottom of the page.
